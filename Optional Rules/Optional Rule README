Optional Rules are some bullshit I made up for scenarios
not covered by the Primary Ruleset, but might not be easy to
come up with on the fly.

Optional Rules are a lot looser than the Primary Rules, and
it's expected you will fill in the blanks on your own.  These
can be changed and/or ignored based on your group's needs.

Current Optional Rules

HOMESTEAD (still in draft)
Rules and considerations for games taking place at one location,
or for a space the players consider their "Base Of Operations"
  Castle
  Little House On The Prairie

STRUGGLE OF MANY (still in draft)
Rules for handling engagements of hundreds or thousands of entities
  Battle Of Vienna (1683)
  Legio IX Hispana in Caledonia (108)

AMONG GIANTS (still in draft)
Rules for when one player is massive, and far more powerful than the
other players
  Dragon-riders Of The Napoleonic Wars
  The Ferrous Behemoth

TO YOUR SHIPS (still in draft)
Rules for when the players are sailing a ship.
  Space Battles
  Pirates
  Sahara Caravan



Let me know if you come up with any interesting ideas to add to or improve this list.
