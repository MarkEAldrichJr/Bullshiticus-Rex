# Bullshiticus-Rex
A simplified TTRPG template that relies on the players and GM to bullshit rules and abilities to create the adventure.  Bullshiticus Rex is meant to require little prep to start, materials that can be scrapped from other boardgames, and a couple-page long manual that can be read and understood in a couple minutes.  I hope you have fun with it, and can offer a hand in its development!  Speaking of which...
